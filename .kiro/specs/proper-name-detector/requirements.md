# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Java library that provides a simple API to determine whether a given word is a proper noun that would typically be capitalized in languages that support case distinctions. For languages without case (such as Chinese, Japanese, Arabic), the library identifies proper nouns for other formatting or processing purposes. The library should identify proper nouns, names, places, titles, and other entities regardless of their current formatting. The library should be lightweight, easy to integrate, and provide reliable detection using various approaches including heuristic rules, known word lists, contextual analysis, and potentially external API calls or LLM integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Java developer, I want to use a simple API to check if a word is a proper noun, so that I can identify entities that require special formatting or processing regardless of the language's case system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the API with a string input THEN the system SHALL return a boolean indicating whether the word is a proper noun
2. WHEN I provide a null or empty string THEN the system SHALL return false
3. WHEN I provide a string with only whitespace THEN the system SHALL return false
4. WHEN the API is called THEN the system SHALL complete the operation within a reasonable time (under 100ms for typical inputs)
5. WHEN I provide input in any case (lowercase, uppercase, mixed) for case-sensitive languages THEN the system SHALL evaluate the word's proper noun status regardless of current formatting
6. WHEN I provide input in languages without case distinctions (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Arabic) THEN the system SHALL identify proper nouns based on linguistic and contextual patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to identify proper nouns across different languages and writing systems, so that it can handle personal names, place names, and other proper nouns correctly regardless of the script used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide personal names in case-sensitive languages in any case (e.g., "john", "SMITH", "mary") THEN the system SHALL return true
2. WHEN I provide place names in case-sensitive languages in any case (e.g., "london", "paris", "NEW YORK") THEN the system SHALL return true
3. WHEN I provide titles and honorifics in case-sensitive languages (e.g., "mr", "dr", "ms") THEN the system SHALL return true
4. WHEN I provide names with common prefixes or suffixes (e.g., "o'connor", "mcdonald") THEN the system SHALL recognize them as proper nouns
5. WHEN I provide proper nouns in non-case languages (e.g., "北京" for Beijing, "東京" for Tokyo, "محمد" for Muhammad) THEN the system SHALL return true
6. WHEN I provide ambiguous words that could be names or common words (e.g., "frank", "smith", "will") THEN the system SHALL use context or probability to make appropriate decisions
7. WHEN I provide known acronyms and abbreviations (e.g., "w3c", "nasa", "fbi", "usa") THEN the system SHALL return true regardless of input case

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to correctly identify common words that are not proper nouns, so that it doesn't produce false positives for regular vocabulary across different languages and writing systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide common dictionary words that are not proper nouns in case-sensitive languages (e.g., "table", "running", "beautiful") THEN the system SHALL return false
2. WHEN I provide articles and prepositions in case-sensitive languages (e.g., "the", "and", "of", "in") THEN the system SHALL return false
3. WHEN I provide common words in non-case languages (e.g., "桌子" for table, "跑步" for running) THEN the system SHALL return false
4. WHEN I provide pure numbers (e.g., "123", "456") THEN the system SHALL return false
5. WHEN I provide random alphanumeric strings that are not acronyms (e.g., "abc123", "test1") THEN the system SHALL return false
6. WHEN I provide strings with special characters that don't belong in proper nouns THEN the system SHALL return false
7. WHEN I provide pronouns that are not proper nouns (e.g., "he", "she", "they") THEN the system SHALL return false, except for "I" which should return true in English

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to be configurable, so that I can adjust its behavior based on my specific use case requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initialize the library THEN the system SHALL allow me to configure detection strictness levels
2. WHEN I configure the library THEN the system SHALL allow me to enable or disable different detection methods (heuristics, name lists, etc.)
3. WHEN I use the library THEN the system SHALL provide default configuration that works well for common use cases
4. IF I want to add custom name lists THEN the system SHALL provide a way to extend the built-in detection capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to provide additional information about its decision, so that I can understand why a word was or wasn't identified as a proper noun.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request detailed results THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores or reasoning for its decision
2. WHEN the system makes a determination THEN it SHALL indicate which detection methods contributed to the result (e.g., name list, place list, heuristic rules)
3. WHEN I need debugging information THEN the system SHALL provide optional verbose output explaining the decision process
4. WHEN multiple detection methods are used THEN the system SHALL show how each method influenced the final result
5. WHEN dealing with ambiguous words THEN the system SHALL indicate the level of uncertainty in its decision

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to handle edge cases and international content gracefully, so that it remains robust in production environments with diverse text inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide very long strings THEN the system SHALL handle them without performance degradation or errors
2. WHEN I provide strings with Unicode characters or international names (e.g., "josé", "münchen", "北京") THEN the system SHALL process them appropriately
3. WHEN external services are unavailable (if used) THEN the system SHALL fall back to local detection methods
4. WHEN the system encounters unexpected input formats THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without throwing exceptions
5. WHEN I provide words from different languages that follow different capitalization rules THEN the system SHALL handle them according to appropriate linguistic conventions
6. WHEN I provide words in languages without case distinctions THEN the system SHALL identify proper nouns without relying on capitalization patterns
